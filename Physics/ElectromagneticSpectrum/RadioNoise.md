# === Document describing radio noise

- [ITU-R P. 372-4](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.372/en) by *International Telecommunication Union* (ITU)

# === Scope of the document and relevant sources of radio noise

The document contains data on radio noise sources for the wave frequencies of ***0.1 Hz*** to ***100 GHz***, covering frequencies used in wireless communication. The main sources of radio noise were identified as:

- ***lower atmosphere temperature***
- ***galaxy***
- ***atmospheric discharge***
- ***man-made sources***

The above sources include eg. *hydrometeors*, *objects in the way of the signal beam*, *extraterrestial radiation* and *radiation from atmospheric discharge*.

The noise generated by the above sources is classified by the ***noise temperature*** and ***noise coefficient***, in order to ptovide comparative criteria for wireless networks solutions.

# === Noise temperature and noise coefficient

## --- Noise temperature

It's a measurement of ***electromagnetic signal interference*** measured in Kelvins. It is described as a temperature in which a respective *Johnson-Nyquist noise* would be created according to the equation:

\[
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_N}{B} = k_BT
\end{equation}
\]

where:
- $P_N$ - noise strength [$N$];
- $B$ - bandwidth in which the noise is measured [$Hz$];
- $k_B$ - Boltzman's constant [$1.381 * 10^{-23} \frac{J}{K}$];
- $T$ - noise temperature [$K$];

## --- Noise coefficient

It's a measurement of ***signal degradation***. It is measured in the dB difference between the noise produced by given receiver and an ideal receiver with the same gain and bandwidth at a **standard noise temperature** (usually ***290 K***).

# === Atmospheric noise

It's an interference caused by atmospheric discharge. It is ***not a Gaussian function***. The probability density function can prove important in determining the efficiency of digital systems. ***Amplitude Probability Distribution*** (APD) of this kind of noise is described as ***voltage deviation*** ($V_d$), defined as ***the ratio*** of the ***root mean square voltage*** to the ***mean voltage*** of the ***noise envelope***. APD curves can be used over a wide range of frequencies.

\[
\begin{equation}
V_d = \frac{V_{RMS}}{V_{mean}}
\end{equation}
\]

where:
- $V_d$ - voltage deviation;
- $V_{RMS}$ - root mean square of voltage;
- $V_{mean}$ - mean voltage of the noise envelope;

# === Man-made noise

It's an interference produced by man-made things, such as eg. city infrastructure. The value of noise strength median from man-made sources follow the linear variation of median ($F_{am}$) with frequency:

\[
\begin{equation}
F_{am} = c - d * log(f)
\end{equation}
\]

| Environment category | c | d |
| --- | --- | --- |
| city area | 76.8 | 27.7 |
| housing estate | 72.5 | 27.7 |
| rural area | 67.2 | 27.7 |
| remote rural area | 53.6 | 28.6 |
| galactic noise | 52.0 | 23.0 |

# Combination of noise from several sources

There are situations where several types of noise need to be taken into the account, because noise originating from different sources have similar magnitude. This especially affects higher frequencies, where atmospheric, galactic and man-made noise can be comparable in strength.

The noise value for each of the sources, that exceed $F_a$ [dB] has distrubution respresented by semi-normal distributions on each side of the median $F_{am}$. The *lower semi-normal distribution* has a standard deviation of:

\[
\begin{equation}
\sigma_L = \frac{D_L}{1.282}
\end{equation}
\]

above the median, and the *upper semi-normal distribution* has a standard deviation of:

\[
\begin{equation}
\sigma_L = \frac{D_U}{1.281}
\end{equation}   
\]

above the median. Each of the *noise coefficients* ($f_a$ [W]) have a *logarithmically-normal districution* on each side of the median.

Median $F_{amT}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_T$ of the noise coefficient for the sum of two or more noise-related processes are described as:

\[
\begin{equation}
    F_{amT} = c * \left[ln(\alpha_T) - \frac{\sigma_T^2}{2c^2}\right]
\end{equation}
\]

\[
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_T = c * \sqrt{ln(1+\frac{\beta_T}{\alpha_T^2})}
\end{equation}
\]
